Code to create this target is is in falseAlarms/target_selection.
It was made by selecting all observed Kepler stars without a known
KOI or EB (villanova) and brighter than 14th magnitude.
Thisresulting in just over 70,000 targets.

Ihave the code in place to do a basic target selection.
We can select based on brightness adn elimitate anything with a large contamination ratio.
I also included those that were not in the CTL and where I couldn't find a nearby contaminating star, but
in the end we maybe don't need to really include these.

I then used tess-point to find those on silicon.
See the target_selection code.
